OppaiOracle L1/L2 Cache — Open Issues Only (Updated 2025‑08‑30)

Open Issues
- L2 explicit mask: L2 still reconstructs padding masks via normalized pad‑color matching. This can be brittle across preprocessing changes or precision drift. Store a compact explicit mask (uint8 H,W) alongside image bytes to avoid heuristics.
  - Evidence: mask reconstruction on read
    - dataset_loader.py:311–326 (DatasetLoader)
    - dataset_loader.py:803–811 (SidecarJsonDataset)

- Documentation on L2 coupling: Even with config‑scoped keys, documentation should clearly state that L2 is tied to preprocessing (image_size, pad_color, normalization, flip policy) and may require invalidation when these change.
  - Action: Update README/operator docs to mention cache invalidation guidance.

Notes
- All other previously reported items were verified or fixed (flip‑aware keys, config‑versioned keys, shape checks on read, L1 fallback mask reconstruction). These are intentionally omitted here.
